# TODOs for fuchs

## Core-programm

### main.py

* [ ] evalute async functions and implement them
* [ ] implement more detailed openapi-conf
* [X] improve error handling
  * [X] embedd api execution in try-except blocks to supply proper error messages
  * [X] move db-assertions to database.py
  * [X] log real cause on server
* [ ] implement a transaction like concept, so that e.g. if saving the
markdown-content of a note fails, but the converted html is already stored on
the hamster, no inconsistencies arise (because it get's rolled back)

## Tests

* [ ] revise unittests
  * [ ] extract tests on failure in seperate test cases (espacially in test_main to test on all failing func calls)
