# DevNotes
Your Personal Notepad

## Access
Theoretically, DevNotes is available under https://notes.pein-gera.de.
However, there are still some issues with the kubernetes ingresses, so it
can only be tested as a local compose stack.

To do so, simply run the command `docker compose up -d --pull always` from
the root directory of this repository. Your personal DevNotes instance should
now be available under http://localhost.
